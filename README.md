Crop Disease in Uganda

ðŸŒ¿ Deep Learning for Computer Vision

This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect crop diseases in Uganda using computer vision. It involves training a model to classify cassava diseases based on image data.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Goal: Develop a deep learning model to identify cassava diseases from leaf images.
Dataset: Images of cassava leaves labeled with diseases such as:

Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
Healthy Cassava Leaves

Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
Frameworks Used: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Matplotlib.
